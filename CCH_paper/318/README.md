This is for investigation of longitidunal trimming strategy

Including:

- Variation of total power with velocity
- Variation of power reduced percentage by using elevator
- Variation of elevator angle with velocity
- Variation of rotors airloads with velocity
- Variation of propeller thrust with velocity
- Relation between total power and rotor airload with different \delta_e under different velocity
- Variation of \theta_0 with velocity
- Variation of \theta_{1c} with velocity
- Variation of \theta_{1s} with velocity
- Variation of \theta_{diff} with velocity

4 configuration:
config.0: no propeller
config.1: only with propeller
config.2: propeller+elevator to obtain maximum power reduced
config.3: propeller+elevator to obtain power reduced with no more than 5% increase of rotor airload (thrust)
